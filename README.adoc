= ADAPT GUI

== Installation

Use `setup.py` to install the ADAPT GUI:

```sh
[...]$ cd path/to/adapt-gui
[adapt-gui]$ pip install .
```

To install in "development mode" (which will allow the `adapt-gui` script to see
your changes to the `adapted` module without manually-reinstalling), add the
`-e` flag to `pip`:

```sh
[...]$ cd path/to/adapt-gui
[adapt-gui]$ pip install -e .
```


== Run-time dependencies

This program assumes that
https://bigchaindb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/node-setup/all-in-one-bigchaindb.html[BigchainDB is running]
and that the `upss-fuse` binary is available in your `PATH`
(e.g., via `cargo install --release` within the UPSS-FUSE project) and that the
https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse#supported-platforms[FUSE library]
is available.
